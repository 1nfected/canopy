NOTE
====
Firefox and Selenium are in a state of flux right now. Firefox 48 and newer will not work with Selenium 2.53.1 which is what canopy uses.

You need to use firefox 47 or older.  I would suggest you use the long term support version available here https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/organizations/
